            In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice 
            President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.
            Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an 
            opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to 
            the A division. Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team.
            Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team 
            within one year.

        <div  class="tab-panel" id="tab2">
            Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999-2000 season, as an 
            eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against 
            Assam cricket team. Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden 
            first-class century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season. Apart from this 
            century, his performance in the 2000/01 season did not include another score over fifty and in the 
            2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.

        <div  class="tab-panel" id="tab3">
            Dhoni's performance in the 2002-03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy 
            and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order 
            contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against 
            Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. Dhoni was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar 
            Trophy 2003-2004 season and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches, including a century (114) against Central zone.
            
            In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone.
            He scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause. Dhoni's talent was discovered via the 
            BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal 
            in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the 
            National Cricket Academy.

            Dhoni started his career with the ticket collector and later became a trophy collector 
            for India. The very humble man by nature. When he gets free time then he goes to the stadium to play cricket, 
            many times his friends helped him to reach out him to stadium Sincerely, he was not currently part of the playing
            eleven in the second T20 match against Ireland. But see the greatness of this player. He gives players in the 
            middle ground with drinks. How many times have you seen such an event in the world of cricket?

            Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match. In the tri-nation

            against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series

                    MS Dhoni, was the captain of the Indian cricket team when they won the inaugural ICC World 
                    Twenty20 (T20) tournament in 2007. The tournament was held in South Africa, and India emerged as the champion 
                    by defeating Pakistan in the final. MS Dhoni played a crucial role in leading the team to victory, and this win 
                    marked a significant milestone in Indian cricket history. Dhoni's captaincy and leadership were instrumental in 
                    India's success in T20 cricket.
